Analysis scripts for noun compound memory research. The following files are analyses for (this paper published in Open Mind)[https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/article/doi/10.1162/opmi_a_00092/116981] entitled _Noun Sequence Statistics Serial Recall and Order Recognition Memory_. In this set of experiments, we were looking at the ways in which sequences of unattested noun compounds, like _tax twig_, affect VWM. Noun compounds are sequences of two or more nouns composed of a noun modifier followed by a head noun, like in the following:

In natural language, nouns are biased to occur in different roles; some nouns are more likely to be noun modifiers (e.g. _tax_ account, _tax_ shelter), whereas other nouns are more likely to be head nouns (e.g. apple tree _twig_). After identifying biases for different nouns in natural language, we identified typical noun modifiers and typical head nouns and composed them into new noun compounds. We looked at whether presenting these new noun compounds in a typical order or a reversed order affected memory:

There were big differences in serial recall:

And order recognition over a long delay (even when controlling for semantic judgments):

This was my first corpus analysis, which was conducted by hand using the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) [portal](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/).
